## Motivation
<p>The concept for Trinder addresses a few points.  As an outdoors-focused individual, I know it can be challenging to find friends who are willing to get into nature at an enthusiastic level.  Another experience Trinder enhances is connecting with folks intra-trip where you can meet and travel with people for certain legs of a trip.  Upcoming features will enhance the networking aspect by creating groups and reviews, and a filtered search for users.
